https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"In the early years of the twentieth century, NBC and Universal began creating their extraordinary legacies in the exciting new worlds of motion picture production and distribution, location-based entertainment, radio and television production and broadcasting. Today, as one company under the ownership of Comcast, NBCUniversal continues to build on this legacy of quality and innovation."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"As the twentieth century began, so did the meteoric rise of the film industry, and moving pictures became a mass entertainment medium. Playing a key role was a German immigrant from Chicago (by way of Laupheim) named Carl Laemmle. Laemmle went on to found the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, a business that would evolve and eventually merge with NBC to become NBCUniversal."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"NBC made it possible for a national audience to share in a single experience, be it a presidential address or a baseball game. David Sarnoff, founder of NBC Radio Network, had envisioned such a service as early as 1915, when he proposed a broadcast radio network whereby ""events of national importance can be simultaneously announced and received,"" and ""baseball scores can be transmitted in the air."" His vision became a reality in 1926, with the founding of NBC."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"As the 20s turned to the 30s, film began to modernize — and Universal studios made a name for itself in the horror genre with the release ofFrankenstein, The Invisible Man, Draculaand more. The 1930s also marked Universal’s first Academy Award Winning film,All Quiet on the Western Front."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"From its beginnings, NBC (and its parent company RCA) was investing in the development of television. World War II stalled this, as the nation's resources were devoted to the war effort (including Brigadier General David Sarnoff, founder of NBC who served as General Eisenhower's communications expert). However in this era, some national events did come to life on TV screens – setting the stage for the rise of TV in America."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"The 1950s saw television become the dominant medium for entertainment and news, with NBC introducing programs that still exist today, likeTODAYandThe Tonight Show. In 1950, just 9% of U.S. households owned a television set. By the end of the decade, the percentage had skyrocketed to almost 90%. In living rooms across America, the radio was relegated to a corner while the TV moved front and center."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"The sixties were a transformative era for entertainment. It marked the opening of the first Universal Studios theme park in Hollywood, California. It also ushered in virtually an entire lineup of television in color on NBC, hallmarked by the famous phrase, ""The following program is brought to you in living color, on NBC!"""
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"During the 70s, NBC became the home of comedy with its iconic laugh track heard throughout millions of homes on shows likeRowan & Martin's Laugh-In, Sanford and Son, and Saturday Night Live."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"Universal released iconic films likeE.T. The Extra Terrestrial, andBack to the Future– ushering in an era of “high concept”, easily marketable filmmaking. In addition, under the creative leadership of president Brandon Tartikoff, NBC became a trailblazer in TV programming with the launch of CNBC in 1989."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"In 1990, broadcast networks captured an average audience nearly four times as large as the cable audience. But just a decade years later, cable viewership zoomed past broadcast and never looked back. NBC capitalized on this growth by developing one of the industry’s largest suites of cable networks, covering news, sports, and entertainment. In the themes parks business, the 1990s saw a new park open, a new annual tradition begin, and a rapid expansion of rides and attractions."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"At the turn of the century, the American public could tune in to just about anything from anywhere, anytime, and on any device. This revolution made the new century an exciting age for content and technology. For media companies like NBC, these changes brought incredible opportunities for innovation. In 2004, NBC and Universal merged to form NBCUniversal."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"Comcast completed its acquisition of NBCUniversal in January 2011. The years since have seen an unprecedented level of investment in the company’s core businesses, a clear sign that Comcast is committed to making NBCUniversal a global leader among media and entertainment companies."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/history,No Specific Heading,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, NBCUniversal faces new challenges – and comes together to create new opportunities. NBCUniversal's industry leadership and innovation continues to propel us into the future – bringing new programs to screens through the rise of streaming, and providing new experiences in parks across the globe."

If they cry, they can cry through a song. When you're doing it to playback, to the millisecond you have to copy what you do.

I thought it was a brilliant idea for a film, so when I ended up leaving that executive position to become a producer at Universal, I said to the studio, “There’s a project I want to take with me, and it’s calledWicked.” Thankfully, they agreed."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"At the time I was developing it as a film, but each screenplay felt that it was missing something. And then one day I got a phone call from composer Stephen Schwartz, who’d written many great musicals for Broadway and film and had won an Oscar for DreamWorks Animation’sThe Prince of Egypt. He said, “I know you have the rights toWicked. Did you ever consider turning it into a musical?” And the lightbulb went off in my head. I thought, “That’s what’s been missing from these screenplays. I don’t feel the magic because it’s a story that wants to sing.”"

I decided I wanted to create this world on stage first. My thinking was that ifWickedbecame successful as a stage musical first, maybe someday I would make a film. Gregory Maguire agreed to let me have the stage rights, and in the late 1990s I began to developWickedas a stage musical. After a number of years of development with Universal as my partner, we put the show on Broadway, and it became a cultural phenomenon. It has played now more than 20 years on Broadway, and has played all over the world, generating about $6 billion worldwide."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"Over the years I was approached many times about turning the stage musical into a film, most especially by Universal because they recognized its potential as a great cinematic experience. For years I had resisted doing that because the stage show was, and is, doing so well, but also because I wanted some distance from what we’d created on stage. I wanted to clear my head, so to speak, and approachWickedin a different, and cinematic, way. This felt like the right time. The opportunity to build a cinematic world that’s vast and epic was an exciting proposition. To be able to dramatize many of the elements that you can’t on stage— flying monkeys, castles, woods, Munchkinland, Emerald City, Shiz University —really opened the door to create a singular experience on film."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"It has taken me 27 years to get to this moment, and to be here is quite thrilling. It makes me feel a little old [laughs], but it’s very exciting."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"MP:Wickedis blessed to have a global fanbase, and they’re invested in every detail of what happens on stage and, therefore, in this film. With any adaptation, there’s pressure to satisfy the dreams and aspirations of the fans. With this film, our job, was to take the essence of what fans have experienced in the theater and now take them beyond that."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"Film allows us to investigate the different worlds ofWicked: Munchkinland, Shiz University, the dormitories, the classrooms, the dwellings where the Animals live, the wondrous Emerald City, the throne room of the Wizard. All these different worlds come alive on film in such a grand, detailed, magical way that it can deliver what the best of cinema does, which is to transport you from your own life and take you somewhere you’ve never been."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"We wanted to take the familiar and then introduce audiences to something new, something exciting, something that goes beyond their own imaginations, without every losing sight of the characters they love, the music that they sing and the world that they have come to feel is their own."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"MP:What’s so interesting aboutWickedis that, as time has gone on, it has become more and more relevant to the world we live in. Gregory Maguire, in his novel, was interested in investigating the nature of good versus evil. Are we born good or evil? Does society imbue us with those qualities, or do we choose a path?Wickedis also a story about what is true and what is not, which is really relevant in the world we’re living in today, particularly a world filled with social media, where people can say whatever they want and it sticks. Whatever is assumed to be true becomes true, even if its false."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"At its heart,Wickedis essentially the story of two young women who are very different. One of whom, Galinda, who will become Glinda the Good, is born to the manor, is beautiful and popular. The other, Elphaba, who will become the Wicked Witch of the West, is born green and is not loved, even by members of her own family. But Elphaba has a magic power that nobody else in Oz seems to possess. The characters are very aspirational, and people see themselves in this world. The characters embody these ideas of doing good in the world, of making sacrifice, of trying to get the truth known. All of that tremendous heart and emotion is in the show, and now the film, while still being a great big entertainment with fantastic music and lots of comedy and adventure."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"MP:One of the great gifts that we have in bringingWickedto film is that because the story is so complex, the themes so rich and varied, the music so wonderful—we don’t have to take a shortcut. So, we decided to tell the story over two films to give each character, each storyline, the justice that it deserves. It allows us to elaborate in organic, exciting ways, many of these themes and stories."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"The world that we’ve created can be more complicated and bigger, our characters can be better articulated, and the epic nature and scale of the piece, as well the epic emotions, can be realized. This first film tells how Elphaba became the Wicked Witch, and the second tells us how Glinda travels the journey to become genuinely good. As two films, it will be an experience for fans, and even for folks who don’t knowWicked,that will live over time as they experience one film and then the next."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"MP:Jon lovesWicked, so he understands the essence of it and he adheres to the heart and soul of these characters and whatWickedis. And yet, he’s so inventive and confident that he’s not afraid to reinterpret a bit, to elaborate further, to take the film on paths that are organic to the story but are where we haven’t gone before."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"He also brought his visual inventiveness, his sense of style and design, in creating the world. He led the charge on how the camera moves, how the film sings and how it dances.  He’s not afraid to go places where the story hasn’t gone before, so his vision is fresh and inventive; it’s bold and energetic. His sensibility is so contemporary yet classic at the same time. I think this film is a crowning achievement for him and it will become a classic. That was important because we want this film, these films, to stand the test of time. We want them to live on forever."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"MP:One of the thrills of coming to set every day was getting to see the creations of production designer Nathan Crowley and costume designer Paul Tazewell and their teams, and all our designers. They created this unbelievably big, rich, mysterious, beautiful world. To watch Ariana Grande as Glinda perform the iconic song ‘Popular’ in Glinda’s dorm room with all her beauty objects and her closets and her shoes, was thrilling. And to see Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba walk through the magical forest of Oz singing the heartbreaking song “I’m Not That Girl’” was a moment I’ll never forget. I just can’t wait for audiences to see all of it."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"MP:The first time I heard them sing together was at Jon Chu’s house. We had a little kick-off dinner. Composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and screenwriter Winnie Holzman were there, along with myself and a couple of others. Stephen was on the piano. And the girls started singing, “For Good.” Now, I’ve known and heard that song for longer than just about anybody alive, more than 20 years, but to hear it from those two voices, with Stephen, who’s always been a hero of mine, playing on the piano … well, everybody in the room was crying. The power of the song, their chemistry, their voices— it was extraordinary."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"MP:This film, from the ground up, has been made for the big screen, and I’m so grateful that Universal made this film. Of course, they’re my partner in the stage production and they’ve been the leader from day one in the whole enterprise. But they’re also very committed to making movies that have to be seen in movie theatres, which is very important to me and to Jon Chu."
https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/behind-magic-oz-producer-marc-platt-20-years-wicked-and-its-enduring-impact,No Specific Heading,"There’s an epic quality to the world that we’ve created. It’s so vast and the camera travels in ways that are breathtaking and truly immersive. The big screen is the only way to truly experience it. The emotions are big, the music is big, and you’re going to want that in-theater sonic experience because these magnificent musical numbers, and the performances by these two women, is singular, believe me. You can’t recreate it anywhere else. Most of all, though, audiences should see it on the big screen becauseWickedis a collective experience. You feel it when you’re in the audience: the way people laugh, the way people applaud, the way people cry. It’s part of what makesWickedso special and part of what gives it its staying power. You can only experience that in theater."

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) defines a ‘sale’ in a way that may include allowing a third party to receive certain information to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you. This profiling powers interest-based advertising on some NBCUniversal sites and services and marketing to you and allows us to keep many of our sites and services at low or no cost."
