                    "In the early years of the twentieth century, NBC and Universal began creating their extraordinary legacies in the exciting new worlds of motion picture production and distribution, location-based entertainment, radio and television production and broadcasting. Today, as one company under the ownership of Comcast, NBCUniversal continues to build on this legacy of quality and innovation.",
                    "As the twentieth century began, so did the meteoric rise of the film industry, and moving pictures became a mass entertainment medium. Playing a key role was a German immigrant from Chicago (by way of Laupheim) named Carl Laemmle. Laemmle went on to found the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, a business that would evolve and eventually merge with NBC to become NBCUniversal.",
                    "NBC made it possible for a national audience to share in a single experience, be it a presidential address or a baseball game. David Sarnoff, founder of NBC Radio Network, had envisioned such a service as early as 1915, when he proposed a broadcast radio network whereby \"events of national importance can be simultaneously announced and received,\" and \"baseball scores can be transmitted in the air.\" His vision became a reality in 1926, with the founding of NBC.",
                    "As the 20s turned to the 30s, film began to modernize — and Universal studios made a name for itself in the horror genre with the release ofFrankenstein, The Invisible Man, Draculaand more. The 1930s also marked Universal’s first Academy Award Winning film,All Quiet on the Western Front.",
                    "From its beginnings, NBC (and its parent company RCA) was investing in the development of television. World War II stalled this, as the nation's resources were devoted to the war effort (including Brigadier General David Sarnoff, founder of NBC who served as General Eisenhower's communications expert). However in this era, some national events did come to life on TV screens – setting the stage for the rise of TV in America.",
                    "The 1950s saw television become the dominant medium for entertainment and news, with NBC introducing programs that still exist today, likeTODAYandThe Tonight Show. In 1950, just 9% of U.S. households owned a television set. By the end of the decade, the percentage had skyrocketed to almost 90%. In living rooms across America, the radio was relegated to a corner while the TV moved front and center.",
                    "The sixties were a transformative era for entertainment. It marked the opening of the first Universal Studios theme park in Hollywood, California. It also ushered in virtually an entire lineup of television in color on NBC, hallmarked by the famous phrase, \"The following program is brought to you in living color, on NBC!\"",
                    "During the 70s, NBC became the home of comedy with its iconic laugh track heard throughout millions of homes on shows likeRowan & Martin's Laugh-In, Sanford and Son, and Saturday Night Live.",
                    "Universal released iconic films likeE.T. The Extra Terrestrial, andBack to the Future– ushering in an era of “high concept”, easily marketable filmmaking. In addition, under the creative leadership of president Brandon Tartikoff, NBC became a trailblazer in TV programming with the launch of CNBC in 1989.",
                    "In 1990, broadcast networks captured an average audience nearly four times as large as the cable audience. But just a decade years later, cable viewership zoomed past broadcast and never looked back. NBC capitalized on this growth by developing one of the industry’s largest suites of cable networks, covering news, sports, and entertainment. In the themes parks business, the 1990s saw a new park open, a new annual tradition begin, and a rapid expansion of rides and attractions.",
                    "At the turn of the century, the American public could tune in to just about anything from anywhere, anytime, and on any device. This revolution made the new century an exciting age for content and technology. For media companies like NBC, these changes brought incredible opportunities for innovation. In 2004, NBC and Universal merged to form NBCUniversal.",
                    "Comcast completed its acquisition of NBCUniversal in January 2011. The years since have seen an unprecedented level of investment in the company’s core businesses, a clear sign that Comcast is committed to making NBCUniversal a global leader among media and entertainment companies.",
                    "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, NBCUniversal faces new challenges – and comes together to create new opportunities. NBCUniversal's industry leadership and innovation continues to propel us into the future – bringing new programs to screens through the rise of streaming, and providing new experiences in parks across the globe.",

Decades earlier, Chu, the acclaimed visionary filmmaker ofCrazy Rich Asiansand the film adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda's stage musicalIn The Heights, had attended early performances of Platt’s seminal show at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco before it transitioned to Broadway. “Jon has a skillset as a visual director,” Platt says. “But what I love the most is his heart and humanity.Wickedis a story of humanity, about people, andWickedwears its heart on its sleeve; so does Jon.
